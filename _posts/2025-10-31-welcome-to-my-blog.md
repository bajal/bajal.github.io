Hello and welcome to my new Jekyll-based blog! This is the first post, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

## What's Coming?

I'll be writing about:
- Software development and programming
- Technology trends and insights
- Personal projects and experiments
- Tips, tricks, and tutorials

## About This Site

This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses the [Solar theme](https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-jekyll), a beautiful theme based on the Solarized color palette by Ethan Schoonover.

The Solar theme features:
- A dark color scheme that's easy on the eyes
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic
- Support for code highlighting

Stay tuned for more content!
